# Evaluating Machine Learning Models to Classify Spam

This project includes analysis of a sample dataset of email messages to predict whether an email is spam.

## Dataset

Spambase, UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, 1999
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase

The dataset was preprocessed and includes 58 distinct columns. 57 columns show unique attributes of the emails' composition, such as how often specific words appear in the text. The 58th column specifies whether the email was spam or not. See the link above for the dataset's complete documentation.

## What's in this project

The `spam_detector.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook includes analysis of the spam dataset.

## Running this project

To run this locally, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook with a Jupyter Runtime, such as a Jupyter Server or VSCode with the Jupyter extension. VSCode recommended.

You may also run the project with Google Collab.
